## Questions

### Q1 Explain the notion of making predictions using models. How can the model that you produced here be ujsed to make predictions? What would this knowledge tell you?

``` text
Predictions in models use statistical or machine learning techniques to predict an outcome based on data patterns. This knowledge could reveal trends.
```

### Q2 Explain how regression models may fail to provide accurate results for prediction

``` text
Regression models may fail if assumptions like linearity, independence, and homoscedasticity arenâ€™t met.
```

### Q3 What does the correlation coefficient indicate?

``` text
The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A positive value near 1 indicates a strong positive relationship, while a value near -1 shows a strong negative relationship. An r close to 0 suggests no correlation.
```

### Q4 How do you interpret the p-value in the summary of the linear regression model?

``` text
The p-value indicates the statistical significance of a variable in predicting the outcome. A small p-value (typically <0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, meaning the variable is likely relevant to the model.
```

### Q5 What does the R-squared value tell you about the model?

``` text
R-squared represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. An R-squared close to 1 implies the model explains much of the variability, while a lower value suggests less explanatory power.
```

### Q6 What does the slope of the regression line represent?

``` text
The slope shows the change in the dependent variable for each unit increase in the independent variable.
```
